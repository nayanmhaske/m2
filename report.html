    <h2>PMI</h2>
    <p>your group should spend some time reflecting on the process and describe here the Pluses, Minuses and Interesting aspects of your teamwork process and result</p>
    <p><strong>Pluses: </strong> One of the biggest strength of working together was the possibility to divide the work by the best abilities of each member of the group. Also this helped to us to learn from other team members.</p>
    <p><strong>Minuses: </strong> One big disadvantage was lack of communication, we could not find time for discussing relevant matters about the website. But we overcame this by communicating through Slack messenger.</p>
    <p><strong>Interesting: </strong>One the most amazing things we discovered doing this website was the possibility to learn how to make the website responsive and we are sure this will help us in our future. Also it helped us to understand how simple code can make a huge difference if we use best practises in coding </p>
